# Tracker
This is an android application that will help you locate the location of your friends and family. In this application, if a user wants to share their location with his/her friend, a code gets generated while registering. That code needs to be shared for others to know your location. When you share a code with your friend/family and if they enter the correct code you shared, you'll get a notification stating the person with whom your location will be shared. You can even check all the people who are getting your location in a separate activity. There's also a feature where you can stop sharing your location to whom you don't want to share it with.
